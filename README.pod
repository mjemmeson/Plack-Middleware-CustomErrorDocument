    $app = Plack::Middleware::CustomErrorDocument->wrap(
        $app,
        # dynamic $path (set according to $env):
        404 => sub {
            my $env = shift;
            ...
            return $path;

        500 => sub { 'path/to/error/doc' },
    );

    # or with Plack::Builder:
    builder {
        enable "Plack::Middleware::CustomErrorDocument",
            404 => sub {
            ...;
        };
        $app;
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dynamically select an appropriate error document for an HTTP status error code.
Pass in a subroutine coderef, which should take C<$env> as the sole argument,
and return the destination file path as a string.

An example use would be to return a 'missing' image file for image requests that
result in a 404 status (and a standard 404 HTML page for all others).
